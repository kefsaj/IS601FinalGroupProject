# IS601FinalGroupProject

For this project, you need to research and develop one unique feature per team member and integrate it into the application that you have been making in the previous homework web application project.  I am not providing any resources for this team project other than the list of 3 possible options for your project.  The objective of this is for you to work with your team to plan, develop, and integrate your features together in a final project.  Each persons work should be easily visible on the site and the site should be organized thoughtfully and cohesively i.e. not just random stuff thrown together.  Come up with a concept for your application that uses these three features, or you can propose a different feature to the professor for approval.  Generally I will approve anything that is of similar difficulty to the options below

Possible Project features (Each team member implement 1)

1.  Use the statistics project to create API endpoints and then consume those endpoints using a JavaScript chart selected from the ones listed in this article here (Links to an external site.).

2.  Create a login and registration process that includes email verification.  You can use a service like SendGrid to send email and you should look for a Flask Plugin to help.

Team Members: Kefin Sajan and Adrianna Brzezinska

Submission Instructions

Submit a link to GitHub with the overall concept for your project and a list of your team members names on the Readme file and a description of the feature that each person completed.  Upload a word document showing the feature working step by step.  Each group member must submit a link to the repo and the word file describing their feature and showing it working.  The GitHub Repository should have a Readme with installation instructions for using the app with Docker, so it can be easily downloaded and run.  If the project can't be downloaded and run with a simple docker-compose up command then it will be rejected and you will automatically receive only 50 points for the project.   You must test your project so that it works and the installation instructions are correct.
